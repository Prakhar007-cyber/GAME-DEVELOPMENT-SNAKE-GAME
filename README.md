DESCRIPTION:

*This interactive game built with SFML library features smooth 2D rendering with textured sprites for the snake segments and food items. The gameplay includes progressive difficulty scaling through velocity increases at defined score thresholds, accompanied by real-time score tracking. Audio feedback includes distinct sound effects for food consumption and collision events, plus optional background music. The object-oriented design separates rendering logic from game state management, featuring a dedicated game loop with frame-rate independent movement calculation. Visual elements include animated sprites, particle effects for scoring, and responsive UI overlays for pause/menu states. The complete package demonstrates core game development techniques including input handling, collision detection, and asset management in C++.*
